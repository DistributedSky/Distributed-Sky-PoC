# Distributed-Sky
Distributed sky is a global traffic management system running on Ethereum world computer.

## Abstract
The project’s team sees the lack of universal air traffic management system as a major bottleneck for unlocking the potential of unmanned aerial systems (UASs). Even though there are [many ways](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/business/meet-your-friendly-neighborhood-drones) “drones” can benefit humanity, applications are still very limited because the system that would allow millions of flights to be coordinated efficiently on the global scale did not exist before.
Distributed Sky is a framework for a global air traffic management system that is running on [a world computer](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/ethereum.html). It is not run in a data-center, but instead leverages a global network of computers to process and store identity, traffic and other crucial information.
